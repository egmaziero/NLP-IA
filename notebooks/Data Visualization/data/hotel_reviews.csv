Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.","Dungeons, Drain Flies and Centipedes",,A Traveler,

The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",Excellent hotel with good access to Venice,,Simon,

Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen.

I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere.

The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.","Good option, great staff, quiet neighborhood",,Matthew,

The room was very clean and there was nice turndown service. The room was adequately lighted and there were outlets to charge electronics.

From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

There were a few hiccups in our stay, but we had such a nice time that the things that did go wrong are forgiven.

I will say the bathrooms are very small (when you open the door there is only about 5 inches from the door to the toilet). The vanity and mirror is spacious, but definitely not for 2 people at once. The Trellis Spa and service from its staff is impeccable, and the gym and outdoor amenities makeup for the age of the hotel. It is hidden away from the busy roads and noise of the surrounding area, so you really feel like you are able to relax as if you were somewhere far away. The views out the windows all around the hotel are views of beautiful tress, as if you were in a secluded rainforest.

It has 3 pools (a massive lap pool, resort pool and other small quiet pool), the largest gym I have seen anywhere, basketball and tennis courts, a jogging track and at least 5 studios for classes. My wife has been a regular (5 times a week) gym user for over 16 years and she has been a member of many gyms in NYC and London and this is by far the best she has experienced. She went to 3 classes and the studios, instructors and equipment could not have been better. Further there is no need to register for any class you just turn up and participate. In the luxurious locker rooms there is free coffee, tea, ice tea, water etc... We also ate at the bar and Olivette restaurant and the food and service were excellent.

Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel.

We had time to go echeck it out before actually booking!! We asked to see a room and were very pleasantly surprises by how lovely and new the hotel and room was!! They. Have done a great job of the Reno!! The hallways, rooms and main areas are clean plus and very tastefully decorated!! The room had great beds and high end quality linens. The room was large and spacious!! We stayed at the hotel for dinner as there was a bar/restaurant on the premesis!! Super friendly staff and the food was of very good quality for pub food!! Nice not to have to go looking for a place to eat after being on the road all day! Another of the hotel amenities was the great gym and pool area!! Dosen,t get any better anywhere!!! High end equipment , pool and jacuzzi!, another great perk is, in the morning the from lobby staff give you a $7.00 voucher per person for breakfast in the hotel!!! This is not your average Best Western!! We had a lovely bacon/ egg brkf for $0,,, All the staff were super friendly and seemed like they loved their jobs!!! My only complaint is the fact that people are allowd to smoke in some of the rooms!! Smoking is not segregated by floors!! We instantly could smell cig smoke when we went to the second floor!! We also could smell MJ coming from one room!! To bad this hotel is allowing smoking within especially since they have done such a fine job of renovating!!

The pillows were hard and lumpy...like when you wash and then high heat dry artificial pillow stuffing and it melts together. The AC unit didn't really work. It just blew air. I was hoping it would cool down to kill the mildew smell, but it never did.

No tienen servicio de traslado areopuerto-hotel-aeropuerto, hay que contratarlo aparte y el hotel no recomienda a nadie especifico.

FYI, the outdoor pool is open until 11 p.m. poolside rooms are fine if you are vacationing with teens or night owls, but if you have toddlers/young children or anyone who prefers to go to bed early in your party, you may want to request a room on another side of the hotel--pool party noise kept us up late the first night (and we WERE the pool party noise the second night when we weren't worn out from traveling!) Several choices for breakfast (make-your-own waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, doughnuts, cereal, toast, yogurt, apples, fruit juice, milk, etc.) and you can get small discounts on tickets to several attractions if you purchase vouchers at front desk. The only very minor service/room condition complaints we had were that one of the electrical outlets was pulling out of the wall, that we had to call to request replacement shampoo/conditioner the second night, and also when we requested pool towels shortly before pool closing, we were asked to go to the front desk to get them, as they could not bring them down to the pool towel cabinet for us at that time (no big deal unless you're already wet from the pool, of course!)

I liked the room layout and comfortable bed with good linens and pillows. The buffet breakfast was extensive including fruit, eggs and sausage (as well as the ubiquitous waffle maker) and low-sugar syrup. What was strange was how closely the breakfast bar attendant watched my every move. I think she was trying to be responsive, but she asked me what I was looking for every time I glanced at the selections. The cons for me were the age of the furniture and fixtures and the cleanliness. I have never cited cleanliness in a review-I can let a lot of things pass. But I cannot accept obvious, fresh stains on both the bath vanity and kitchenette counter, especially when they wipe away easily with water, suggesting that not even a rag was dragged across them. The hotel staff was very nice, but always a turn-off for me when they walk in from their cigarette break at the front of the hotel as you walk in behind them. Surprisingly this hotel and the Wingate were nearly equally ranked (and priced) on this site. They are not similar in quality. I checked out the Wingate while in town. It has a much nicer lobby and breakfast room, where a hot breakfast is provided, not a continental as described. The room I was shown had newer furniture, granite kitchenette counter and tile tub/shower surround. Closer to town, it has a few stores within walking distance.",Better Choices,,Richard,

Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room.

I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation.",Good location not the best place,,A Traveler,

There was a charge for parking your car at the hotel. Not very much, but a bit of a cheek when there's no real alternative. It's a bit like a restaurant charging you extra to use cutlery! It was also a bit tricky to find. There's a sign on the main road saying to turn right after 200 metres, but even if you're good at estimating distances and take the correct turning, you could still fail to find it!

My room (classic) was fine, even though the layout of it was unfortunate, but the hotel is old and I guess they can't help the big pilar in middle... I booked through Hotels.com and asked for a quiet room. They remembered this and gave me a room on the street side, which was definitely quieter. In addition, the room had a separate door leading to the bedroom, which made the experience quieter. The breakfast was great and included sparkling wine. I enjoyed the fresh fruit and croissants! I wasn't that impressed by dinner, however. I had a steak, which was cooked as I asked, and the wine was good with it, but the list overall just wasn't to my taste. The pool area only have staff bringing out the lounge chair mattresses at 10am though, so if you're earlier than that you have to bring your own towel from your room and settle with that... this was a bit disappointing. Also while they serve you drinks and snacks to your lounge chair, they will not come to you to take your order - you have to go to the bar yourself. The fitness room is by the pool and separated by glass (leading to the pool). It's clean with towels, but there is no air conditioning and only 3 pieces of equipment. Overall a brilliant hotel! I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend them to everyone else","Random location, great service!",,Johanna,

I wasn't impressed by the location as the main entrance is off a rather run down street. The back was nicer as it was on the marina but it was a fairly long, hot walk to all the major attractions. My room was more than adequate and looked like it had been recently updated. The view was grim but I didn't pay for a sea view so I was stuck looking at concrete. I like to work out first thing in the morning but I couldn't use the tiny gym because it was out by the pool and didn't open until 10am and breakfast (which I'd paid for in my room rate) was served 7.30-10.30 so time was not on my side. The breakfast was nice but I would not have paid the 29 that was quoted on the menu. The view from the breakfast room and balcony was lovely and one of the best things about the hotel. I'm very glad I wasn't there high season as the hotel is literally right beside Tito's a very popular nightclub. I did hear some noise a couple of times in my room at night but luckily it seemed to be people walking by the back of the hotel so it didn't last long. The pool was nice- lots of loungers. The staff were fairly friendly on the whole. I had room service once and it was of good quality. I didn't like the 4.50 service charge to bring it to my room and then having the guy hanging there expecting a tip. They charge for practically everything. No water in room on arrival and I was thirsty!!",Didn't quite live up to price tag,,traveler,

We wanted to celebrate our anniversary at a nice hotel in Mallorca but it was subpar at best. Hotel is decorated with antique furniture which made the hotel and the rooms smell pretty bad. They also used this very heavy fragrance which made staying at all common areas, such as lobby or bars, quite unbearable. To make things worse, there was a post in the middle of the room which made moving around difficult in a small room. The hotel told us that we had to pay extra in order to change the room as that was the only room available for the price that we paid. One can probably find a much better hotel for the price you pay for this hotel. Service can certainly improve as well. Location is quite awkward as well. It's about 40 minute walk to the city centre and it's not close to the beaches either. Unfortunately, I don't have anything nice to say about this hotel.",Don't deserve 5 star rating!,,Judy,

Problem with ants in the room which was not handled well by the hotel .

We never ate dinner in the main restaurant but the breakfast had an excellent choice everything from full cooked English to fresh fruit, natural local yoghurt and lots of cereals or pastries. The Cava on ice was a nice touch. The rooms are modern but with an old world charm, from the1930s () marble style bathrooms to solid wood writing desks and comfortable arm chairs. Comfortable beds, plenty of hot water and wifi in the rooms. Overall the decor and furnishing in this hotel speaks of solid old fashioned quality in a modern well-run establishment. Sure if you look at your feet as you walk, you will see the odd threadbare carpet in the corridors but it completely fits with the feel of a well-loved lived in country mansion that isn polished from top to bottom daily. The lay-out of the public areas around the foyer was very homely.....arranged in such a way with plants, rugs and large pieces of antique () furniture that each section felt like your own private sitting room and even when the hotel was busy, it never felt crowded.

She had been to this hotel and was delighted when I chose it. Breakfast was amazing - there was nothing else they could have added to such a comprehensive choice. We had one evening meal which was delicious and the waiting staff were charming and attentive. The only criticism I have is that the wifi is not up to today's requirements. I am sure that many guests like me want to take advantage of Netflix which is now available in Europe and it was very frustrating to keep dropping the signal and having to wait or abandon the exercise entirely. Otherwise great hotel.,Lovely hotel with great view of the port of Palma,,wendy,

Oh they had them, the ones you make from powder. Anywho, the staff is kind of uptight, though they play it like if they are actually being friendly.

Initially, it was difficult to get a hold of someone to set up tours and discuss booking, but I believe this was because the staff was in flux at the time. Once Sabrina began handling our event, it was smooth sailing. Sabrina was very patient while my fiance and I went over the contract with a fine-toothed comb. She was able to address all of our concerns, answered all of our questions, and was very accommodating. When we booked the venue, we knew we had chosen the right place.Our day of coordinator was Michelle who was top-notch. I first met her at our menu tasting; she's charming, kind, and knowledgeable. I felt I could ask her the smallest/stupidest questions. I did most of the planning long-distance so prompt e-mails were important to me. Michelle and I were able to communicate most things through e-mail, and she did a great job making sure I didn't forget anything. On the day of the wedding, I honestly did not worry about a thing. I had such a wonderful time and it's because Michelle took care of everything. She helped make it an event to remember.My guests were impressed with the decor at the Citizen - I had many compliments on how beautiful and elegant the setting was. The terrace, along with the Capitol Building in the background, is breathtaking. I heard many people say that the food was fantastic, and one person said it was the best wedding food he's ever had. The guests also loved how each room is unique. The Reservations Manager, Megan, was also very easy to work with and allowed me to change many things, even at the last minute. We were in the Governor's Suite for the wedding, and the room is, of course, fabulous.My only critiques would be that there is no free wi-fi, but you can sign up for the Joy of Life Club and get free wi-fi that way. Parking can also be a concern, especially if you are part of the wedding party and need to go to and fro. But we all managed. Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our wedding and feel the Citizen Hotel did a fantastic job. Thank you!",,,geminix03,

He wrote the book How Great Companies get their Mojo from Maslow. The Citizen Hotel helped move me a bit up the pyramid, but being in Sacramento couldn't fully bring me to self-actualization. Oh well, can't have everything. It's an old downtown bank turned boutique hotel with dark reds and blacks and great drawings and political cartoons along the wall. The best is the black and white pic of a young buff Arnold Schwarzenegger, shirtless and in speedos, flexing with a group of bridesmaids in the women's bathroom in the parlor. The room was spacious, swanky, sophisticated. Dripping with old school charm and modern day luxuries. An Apple-lovers haven -- iPhone docks, macs in the business center. Dual shower heads, decent products, sitting room with a second flat screen TV (although I learned I had the ADA room). Steamer instead of an iron (LOVE), roomy, cozy, great bed, decent mini-bar.

We stayed in the penthouse suite and the governor's suite and loved both rooms. Both rooms had balconies overlooking Sacramento. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. I mainly worked with 3 ladies and they were all wonderful. They made everything so easy and were always quick to respond to my emails (all of the millions of emails I sent them).

She also conducted our rehearsal, which took so much weight off my shoulders the day before when I was about to crack! The serving staff also went above and beyond to make sure we got to enjoy dinner and they even left champagne and left overs in our room for us to enjoy after the wedding was over.As for the venue itself, it really speaks for itself. The tented 7th floor terrace with a view of the capitol is exquisite to the point that minimal decorations are necessary. The food is local and sustainable and tasted every bit as good as during our tasting at the Grange. The food at the cocktail hour got especially rave reviews. The hotel put guests with children on the same floor as the terrace, so some families put their kids to bed and then were able to return to the reception to dance! The bell staff was also extremely helpful over and over with all of our stuff and multiple cars going in and out of valet.

The outside looked fairly nice except they had two pedestals , one at each doorway, to put cigarettes out in and they clearly had not been emptied in quite a long time. Even as a long time smoker, this was quite unpleasant and smelly. I like that the cigarette disposals were available when I went outside for an occasional cigarette, however, the fact that they were not emptied in a while and the fact that they were swimming in rain water from earlier in the day, was off putting even to me.

Around 6:45 in the morning heard gurgling sounds from the bathroom. I went to check it out and found sewage coming up through the shower and toilet that wouldn't flush. Soon it became apparent that this is happening through the entire hotel, not just our room. Plumber was called, but no shower, no bathroom and no breakfast due to breakfast are being flooded. We left for the day and when we returned at night we found that the sewage backup has been cleared but no one cleaned the bathroom or made the room afterward. So we ended up CLEANING THE SHOWER TUB OURSELVES in order to be ready for dinner in time. When we confronted the staff bout it, the guy behind the desk offered to send a cleaning crew, which we declined because it was too late. And then for some reason the lady behind him got an attitude and started telling us it's our fault that the room wasn't cleaned because *she* thought we already checked out. Why she thought that when all our stuff was still in the room that we prepaid for, she couldn't say. We went on to find out that TV and the iron did not work. The worst part of all this is that they refused to make ANY of this right, told us to take up our complaints with Hotels.com.

The brochurers for Sept. had already been thrown away and Oct- Dec. in its place. So we had no idea what there was to do in this town. I couldn't get connected to Internet wirelessly nor through cable. So I couldn't look things up and I could not send my work via internet at all during my stay. The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels. This was very clean, but other than that it was a huge waste of our money. For the price of these rooms I expected a great deal more. A balcony for sure when your paying for a river view.

It was my girl birthday, so I call them to make sure that I got a large bathtub and a king size bed. When I got to my room, I had the smallest tube in the world. Remind you that I'm 6'1' and a big dude. They also gave me a small double bed. My leg was hanging out the bed the whole night. To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room. I once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room that gave me everything I wanted in orlando, a king size bed and clean sheet. I wish I could get my money back.

It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service.

There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future.

I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects.

I can never repay the kindness and understanding of Ed and Janie. They truly bent over backwards to make our stay as comfortable as possible. All of the condiments were in the cupboard we needed, same with dish soap, the towels and wash cloths were so soft and absorbent. If we had a question or needed anything, we just popped over to their house and asked. Simple as that. Was it perfect like a chain motel, no, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, I was expecting exactly what we got. Just like home - well lived in and comfortable.

What's the 3-queen suite you ask A 2-queen suite with the sofa, chair, coffee table removed and a 3rd bed put in leaving one chair for the everyone to fight over at the desk. The bathroom had to be the smallest I've ever been in with a stand-up shower that had a curtain too short leaving the floor a mess when done. The shower head wasn't centered on the shower which added to the mess. The continental breakfast was an absolute joke! A couple of varieties of cold muffins/pastries, 2 kinds of cereal, weak coffee, and one waffle maker that everyone waited in line for. The man behind the counter was extremely nice the evening we arrived. That was a plus. I think the cleaning crew picked our room to eat their Indian take-out as it smelled like curry when we returned that evening! Can't think of another reason as none of the cleaning crew looked of Indian decent. I know we went to Durango right in the midst of vacation season, but the old saying, You get what you paid for rang true at the hit of 125/night.

My first complaint was the price for what was given. I am sure that because of the high demand in this market, prices are based on supply and demand. Having said this, I was prepared to pay a higher price for the two nights we stayed. However, there is no excuse for a room that had dead bugs on the window sills and hair in the bathtub. These were not cleaned out between the two days of our stay. After seeing the dead bugs in the bathroom window, i found evidence of more dead bugs in the room. With this, I felt like the room was not being cleaned properly and only made us doubt the cleanliness of the room for the remainder of our stay. Also, I found a large bite on my right arm after the first night. I am almost certain this happened in the room on our first night. The TV was an older type of TV, not the more modern version flat screen. That was not a particular problem as much as that the TV did not even work. We were told that the remote was probably the problem so they traded it out for a new one and that also did not work. So for two nights we had no TV. Again, I was prepared to pay the higher cost but in this case felt like I was taken advantage of.

The amount of noise from the rooms around us was incredible. The next morning we asked to move to a room where a guest had checked out-again we were told none were available. After returning to our room we received a call saying one was avail and we could move rooms immediately. Since this was first thing in the morning it tells me that this room was avail when we checked in. If you want a quiet hotel, DON'T stay here. When a door from a room closes or when someone walks heavy in the hall or in their room, the entire building shakes it can be heard loudly in the room next door below. There was a baseball team with kids that appeared to be 10 yrs old staying here and running wild. The noise and floor/building rattling from a baseball team running up and down the hallways was very disturbing. The parents not once told the kids to stop running. It was really sad the lack of respect being shown to other guests. We talked to the front desk and they told us that it is not their place to say anything to the kids. Yes it is!! It is up to you to ensure the comfort of all your guests and if kids are being too loud and parents aren't around, you can tell the kids to stop running in the halls and to be quiet.

Clean, well organized hotel. The room had fairly old carpet, with a few stains, but didn't feel dirty - just old. Otherwise the room was well kept, sheets were very clean. The hotel in general was well maintained and clean. The free breakfast was good and the WiFi signal was strong and data came through quickly. The TV had a few basic channels, standard HBO was Spanish only, but that was fine. The pool is clean and centrally located. I loved that it offered free stay for our dog, but there is almost zero places to walk your dog so they may do their business. The only places were a few gravel medians and side areas, but it worked out okay. The location isn't great - not much to walk to directly next to the hotel, but a 8 minute drive does get you to Reid Park. Traffic was terrible in the area though, which made leaving the hotel to the south very difficult. I would stay here again.",Great Staff at Clean Hotel with Standard Amenities,,Benjamin,

The beds were comfortable, too, although more pillow options would have been even better. I like a softer pillow than what was offered, but that's my own preference. We also had some trouble with the room air conditioning system, mostly due to the remote used to operate it, which seemed simple enough and we had thought we had things running properly, until we were awakened in the night due to the room being way too stuffy. That's when we discovered the remote had a hidden flap with more buttons that we randomly pressed until the A/C fan turned on. Sometimes being high-tech can be a problem, especially without instructions. A little card in the room to explain things would have been very helpful. The hotel was nicely maintained and the lobby was warm and inviting, with friendly staff.

The desk staff is very pleasant, the courtyard when you walk up is cute. The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena.

The inn is no more than 3 block from the Key Arena entrance. When the concert was over, we were back in our room within 15 minutes. The inn is older and basic.

Well, when we checked in we were told the parking lot was full, sorry. I was shocked and disappointed that no other explanation or assitance was given. The lady at reception simply handed me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street. Well, good luck finding street parking on a Friday evening! We drove around for over an hour until we could find a spot. We then had to move our car in the morning before the race. This was a huge inconvenience. We stopped by hotel reception after driving around for an hour to inquire about late check-out. We were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out, and even after explaining our frustration about driving around for an hour (or more) looking for parking, she simply said, there's nothing I can do. We were very disappointed in the lack of service, lack of genuine apology, and absence of any sort of gesture for our inconvenience.

I walked up the stairs and opened the door to the hallway and the scent of marijuana made me gag... yes literally. Our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room. I looked for the AC and tried to turn it on and for 15 minutes it blew hot air so and I smelled the bed and it smelled like marijuana and I really could not stay there so I left hoping they could move me to another room. The manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me and I told her I could not sleep in a room and on sheets that smelled of marijuana. She said that was all they had and I told her I would have to leave then and she got an attitude with me saying I would have to pay for the full time and I said it was a night cancellation fee and I did not cancel the room you put me in smells of marijuana, the noise of drunk stoned patrons and the lack of AC in the room to get the smell out was just not acceptable.

The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I love that you use an actual key to get in your room. You also get a key for the front door if you come back late at night. The bed has a pillowtop and comfy pillows. The Inn is within walking distance of the Space Needle and only a block away from Seattle Center.

We returned to our room at night, after being out all day, and found the door wasn't securely shut and gave way to a simple push. Panicked, we took inventory of our possessions and luckily discovered nothing missing. I hate to think of what may have happened if an intruder entered the room and my wife returned alone. After informing the front desk, I wrote an email to the gen mngr and got a reply from their op mngr the next day. She informed me that our room had been accessed by keycards that were issued at check-in. I informed her that there was no way that we could have accessed our room during the times she gave me. She couldnt offer an explanation of how or why our door lock showed access. While we were away I know that staff had entered to clean so its safe to assume that it was staff who left the door unlocked/open. Again, a simple push opened the door so a simple push by staff to check if the door was securely shut would have sufficed to ensure our safety. Since we were offered no real explanation of why our door wasnt securely shut that night, I do not recommend staying at this Marriott location if you value your safety and the safety of your belongings.

We all had black dirt and grime under our feet after only 2 hours of being in the room! The dishes in the cupboards were all dirty. ALL of them! It was so gross. There was dried food on everything. Check out was a nightmare for my mother. The two people working the front desk at check-in did not swipe our credit cards correctly and there was no record of my card ever being swiped. Which is INSANE because we actually saw them do it! At this point my family and I were already on an airplane home, so my poor mom had to check out alone and deal with this. They put the entire cost of the room on her credit card because there was no record of my card. We aren't a rich family. We saved for a very long time to afford this trip and in one swipe this Residence Inn completely ruined my mother financially.

Everything looked fine UNTIL my 3 year old son was wearing black shorts and socks and had sat on the floor only to get up and have his whole bottom and socks covered in WHITE FUR. I turned on all the lights and DISCOVERED that the carpet was covered in what seemed to be dog or cat fur, my mother in law and I looked at each other and noticed our clothes were covered in it too as well as our luggage. Once again I went downstairs as we were leaving for dinner asking the front desk if there was anyway to send someone to at least vacuum the room or to get me the vacuum so I do it, she said house keeping was gone and they could possibly send me one when I came back. I didn't get the vacuum and the next morning my mother in law woke up with a SWOLLEN face and itchy throat (she is MILDLY ALLERGIC to animal fur but thats how much fur was in the room that it caused her to have a SEVERE allergic reaction).

Don't look in the corners of the bathroom. Just don't. Bed was ok, but the spread on top was questionable in cleanliness. BREAKFAST: Scrambled eggs, no breakfast meat as advertised, biscuits gravy -ok, cereal, bagels, toast, Danish. Not as advertised.

I lodged a complaint about broken furniture that might have caused me an injury. The owner implied that perhaps I broke the furniture. It was a sofa bed in the front room of the suite. I was charged 120.00 for the suite. When I checked in, I was told there was wet bar. When I got in the room, there was nothing, but an empty refrigerator and cabinets, which is not the definition of a hotel wet bar. When I sat on the bed, ...view morethe frame broke. When I tried to get out, it broke again. My roommate had to come and help me get out of thebed. Then the bed could not be put back in the couch. I have had a hip replacement. Sitting on that sofa bed with a broken frame that fell in could have caused damage to my hip. And, that was not all the curtains in the room were too short to cover the entire window so there was light in the room all night. The last straw was that the room had a hair dryer that would not stay on while in use. I had to hold the on button to use the dryer, which made it totally useless. Our stay was not a good experience. I have stayed in Best Western Hotels all over the US and never used one with this many problems. When I asked for a reduction in my charge, I was given only a 20, instead of a no charge for the room. I would not have been so disgruntled had the owner, Sarah Patel, given me a free night, but she did not. The hotel furniture was dangerous, did not have the wet bar that it promised, and did not have appropriate window coverings. Sarah Patel, owner of the establishment, provided (1) poor services, (2) unsafe equipment and (3) inoperable appliances.

If we could of gotten our money back we would of changed hotels. We stayed in the Jungle room which meant they put about 50 stuffed animals over the bed and hung monkeys from the ceiling.

There was a nice sized fridge, coffee maker, full-sized hair dryer and great shower head with great linens and grooming products. The Holiday Inn was conveniently just outside the Canyon and very close to Chinle. Native Guides are waiting in the Hotel if you want to go into the canyon. Guided trips vary from 3 hours to 6 hours, and the type of vehicle varies as well. My family went in a closed (vs. No windows, open-sided) Suburban which offered protection from the elements and a bit more comfort. Ask for Harold and his family. My family was impressed with H.'s knowledge of the canyon history, etc. He graciously answered many questions. We went into town for dinner even though the dinner special was steak for under 15.

They refused to refund me for the night I did not use. It does state this in their bi laws, but to tell the truth, this has never happened to me before so I did not look. MY experience is it is typical for hotels to refund canceled reservations if they are 36 hours in advance. What right has a hotel to do refuse to refund w sufficient notice. That should not be legal. Would you buy clothes or tools at a shop that had no refund policy They do it because they know they are only one of two hotels in this impoverished little town. Do yourself a favor, stay an hour away in Kayenta, at Monument Valley. There's no night life in Chinle so its not like you need to be around in the evening. Also their restaurant was extremely expensive, so we did not eat there. We ate at a Chinese resturaunt on the main road. The food was typical, but the staff were fun to be around.

The sites were amazing, some well know spots but mostly places I'd never heard off, stone circles, ancient tombs, islands etc. Overnight stops were great, accommodations were very good and all centrally located, so no long walks or taxis. The bus was small and very comfortable, reclining seats, air conditioning, lots of leg room and space for day packs. Anything bigger just couldn't get to the places we visited; along tiny, twisting Irish back roads (So glad I didn't drive). The guide/driver was a fountain of knowledge, treating everyone as his new best friend. Stories and info flowed easily and I never felt like I was receiving a lecture. We could stop anytime we wanted for a photo and we had plenty of time at sites; we just all sauntered back to the bus when we were ready.

Fortunately the hotel had a room for the second night, just not the same room. The first night our room faced the street, so there was traffic noise with the window open. The next night we faced the parking lot. The bed in the first room was like sleeping on a rock. We like a firm mattress, but this was ridiculous. The second night, the bed was much better, firm without being rock-hard. That room was huge with two king beds and a sofa bed. It could have very comfortably slept 6 people without feeling crowded. Both rooms had a microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. The bathrooms were also large, and the second room had a spa tub. During the stay I interacted with four different employees--all very pleasant. Breakfast was good, the usual cereals, yogurt, fruit, waffles, muffins, juice, coffee. The first day they had hard-boiled eggs, but the second day they were out. I missed the protein. There were several restaurants nearby, but we didn't go to any of them so I don't have a recommendation. The parking lot is fairly small, so if you have a large vehicle I would suggest parking in a place where you'll be able to get out easily. Our only complaint was the very poor internet service. The desk clerk gave us an Ethernet cord, but that didn't help. We were here midweek, and the price was reasonable. We would definitely stay here again.","Same Hotel, Two Different Rooms",,vicki,

There was some remodeling upgrades being done so my only complaints were the strong stench of paint paint thinner in the halls, However, a slight oversight considering it's for repairs. Also the ice machine on our floor was out of service so we had to go all the way to the lobby every time. Both the day and evening clerk were very nice. We had food delivered to the room because it was storming but there were tons of places to chose from. Less than 10 minutes from the beach. Wish there were places near home as nice because I stay in hotels often between work and travel. I would absolutely stay there again. I slept almost a whole day it was so peaceful.

There's an Aldi grocery store across the street if you need snacks or other food items. The basic breakfast was nice for a quick bite before leaving there was yogurt, toast, cinnamon rolls, muffins and even waffles. The only complaint that I have has nothing to do with the motel or staff it was the guests. A bunch of high-school or college age punks were staying there too and created lots of noise and disturbances they behaved like the place was their dorm or frat house.

But they are very expensive compared to other rooms. This vacation, we stayed in 1 cheap hotel (57) and 1 expensive hotel (168). Huge difference, and while the expensive one was far superior, I have to believe there was something good in the middle somewhere... The only major problem was the sink did not drain. They poured Drain-O down it immediately, so the fast response was appreciated, but it did not work. Everything we would have normally had to do in the sink, we had to do in the tub, like brushing our teeth, washing hands, etc. This isn't easy, especially with a toddler. The rooms were clean and nicely made up, and the beds were really comfortable. Unfortunately, we didn't get time to try out the pool, though I noticed after we left that it was saltwater, so my kids would have hated it. Breakfast is always good, and is free.

And that staff in other locations always made eye contact/smiled/had a positive comment.Only tiny negative was finding a previous patron's leftovers in the mini fridge.,How to feel spoiled,,A verified traveler,Rochester NY

When I arrived, without warning, the bellhop led us to a standard double room (the cheapest type, with no balcony). I explained to him that we'd reserved a room w/ a balcony, he called the front desk and they told him none was available. He handed the phone to me & I asked the girl on the other end if I could speak to a manager. He was rude, did not apologize for the situation, & flatly told me that because I had booked through a certain third-party reservation site, there was nothing he could do about the error. He eventually clarified that since I had booked a room with one bed (albeit a King), but had asked for a second bed, they simply changed the reservation to a double room. He said there was no way to notify me of this, because the third-party reservation company does not supply the names or phone numbers of people who make reservations. He had no explanation for how the hotel front-desk staff had been able to match my name & ID to a reservation. Anyway, he refused to refund the difference in the price of the room. He offered to put us in a room with a balcony the next day. He told me to start calling them the next day at about noon to see if one would be available. One eventually did come available the next day at 5 p.m. & we took it. It was too dark to even see the balcony (half the point of a balcony room was to have the extra sunlight). I complained about it long enough that an hour later, someone showed up with a free bottle of wine & an apology letter for the ""miscommunication"", but there was never a refund of the difference in the price of the rooms, & the bad customer service made the trip a little worse than it needed to be.Our first room on the 6th (top) floor had too little water pressure to take a good shower. Other than that, the hotel itself was perfectly nice. Hopefully the manager moves on. I may try it again next time I'm in the area, but I would not recommend booking this hotel through a discount hotel website.",Easily could have been better,,A verified traveler,Rochester NY

Old Town Alexandria is charming, and the hotel is right in the middle of it. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. The restaurant next to the hotel is a bit spendy, but pretty good. The room itself was a bit small, and I would have liked a lock on the bathroom door, but the beds and pillows were comfy, and the TV service adequate. Going into downtown D.C. was ~50 minutes door-to-door (to White House) by metro. I feel the hotel should offer a shuttle to the metro. We had to taxi, since the King street trolley only runs from 11AM - 7PM--walking to the metro, while doable at 20m, would have made for a tiring day touring D.C. The parking garage is old and space is tight, so a couple nights we had to pay to park elsewhere, but its workable. Most staff were nice, but a few times the staff were slightly less than helpful: room service comes too late in the day, and kept harassing us even though our child was napping and we asked them to come back later. One day while it was pouring rain outside, we tried to borrow an extra umbrella from the doorman (we're a family of 4 with 2 young kids), and were rebuffed [??]. But, the kids hour and wine hour are great, and the hotel is fun. Bottom line, the location is great, and the charm of the hotel and the surrounding area make some of the small inconveniences insignificant.","Great location, some small tradeoffs",,Ryan,Austin TX

When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway.

We finally had to walk down to find and retrieve it ourselves. - Found a black hair under the comforter upon arrival. - We were out of the room for at least 7 hours during the next day and no one cleaned our room. - The TV picture flickered on almost every channel. - We asked for a cart to bring our luggage down at checkout and no one came after 20 min. Finally had to go down to get one ourselves. Downstairs, an empty cart was sitting next to several bellhops who were chatting away to one another.",Not up to Kimpton Service Standards,,Kris,Boston MA

The staff is ever present and helpful. The only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. We later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. And the bar closes early. There were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 I believe. There is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. One of the pourers actually remembered what I and my wife drank the night before. Finally, I had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. We missed two because we were slow in getting there. Doesn't bother me, but I wonder if some seniors might find it difficult.

We were somewhat concerned about the fact that the hotel welcomes pets - but our room was perfectly clean and the furniture in good condition.

DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be.

Plenty to do in Old Town Alexandria. Close to transport for easy access to Arlington or Washington. Rooms very clean and comfortable.

The location was great and the interior design was fun and comfortable. The service was great at both the front desk and when I needed something. The only complaint I have is the cost of room service. If you order a meal in to your room, they essentially charge you TWO fees. One of which I hadn't noticed before I ordered. Other than that, it was a great place to stay.",business traveler from Boston,,A verified traveler,Boston
